## What is Prismatic?

Prismatic is the integration platform for B2B software companies. It's the quickest way to build integrations to the other apps your customers use and to add a native integration marketplace to your product.

Prismatic significantly reduces overall integration effort and enables non-dev teams to take on more of the integration workload, so that you can deliver integrations faster and spend more time on core product innovation.

With Prismatic, you can:

- Build reusable [integrations](https://prismatic.io/docs/integrations) in a low-code integration designer that's tailored for your product
- Use [pre-built components](https://prismatic.io/docs/components/component-catalog) to handle most of your integrations' functionality, and write [custom components](https://prismatic.io/docs/custom-components/writing-custom-components) when needed
- Quickly add an [integration marketplace](https://prismatic.io/docs/integration-marketplace) to your product so customers can explore, activate, and monitor integrations
- Easily deploy customer-specific integration [instances](https://prismatic.io/docs/instances) with unique configurations and credentials
- Provide better support with tools like [logging](https://prismatic.io/docs/logging) and [alerting](https://prismatic.io/docs/monitoring-and-alerting)
- Run your integrations in a purpose-built environment designed for security and scalability
- Use powerful dev tools to mold the platform to your product, industry, and the way you build software

## Who uses Prismatic?

Prismatic is for B2B (business-to-business) software companies, meaning software companies that provide applications used by businesses. It's a good fit for products/teams ranging from early-stage and growing SaaS startups to large, established software companies looking to improve the way they do integrations.

Many B2B software teams serve customers in niche vertical markets, and we designed Prismatic with that in mind. We provide powerful and flexible tools so you can build exactly the integrations your customers need, no matter who your customers are, no matter what systems you need to connect to, no matter how "non-standard" your integration scenario.

## What kind of integrations can you build using Prismatic?

Prismatic supports integrations ranging from simple and standard to complex, bespoke, and vertical-specific.
Teams use it to build integrations between applications of all kinds, SaaS or legacy, with or without a modern API, regardless of protocol or data format.
Here are some example use cases:

- Use job data from your system to create invoices in your customers' ERP.
- Import and process data from third-party forms that vary significantly from customer to customer.
- Email activity summary reports with parameters and intervals defined on a per-customer basis.
- Build AI-powered assistants that can search, analyze, and interact with your systems.

## AI Agent Examples

This repository includes examples of AI-powered integrations using OpenAI's Agent SDK:

- **[OpenAI Agent Integration](ai/openai-agent/)** - A comprehensive example with different flows showcasing progressively advanced agent patterns including basic chat, tool usage, agent composition, API wrapping, human approval workflows, and intelligent routing.
- **[Slack AI Starter Kit](ai/slack-ai-starter/)** - A minimal starter kit for building AI-powered Slack apps. Clean, simple foundation with just OpenAI agents and Slack Assistant framework - perfect for getting started quickly.
- **[Slack AI Assistant Example](ai/slack-chatbot-agent/)** - A full-featured example showing advanced patterns including web search tools and dynamic integration discovery with Prismatics Agent Flows API. Great reference for companies building sophisticated AI assistants.

These examples show how to build intelligent integrations that can understand context, make decisions, and interact with various systems on behalf of users.
